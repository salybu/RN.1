# Introduction

## 1.1 easy way from a web developer to an iOS/ Android developer

- The point of this course for me is to show you _**as a `React.js` developer how easy it is**_ to go _**from being a `web developer` to becoming an `ios and android developer`**_.

- If you learn react, if you know what is _**state, props, components**_, all that stuff, you will see how easy it is going to make _**ios and android applications**_.

&nbsp;

## 1.2 What are the requirements to take this course?

There're 2 kinds, _**`head` requirements**_ and _**`computer` requirements**_.

- in head, all you _**need to know is `Reactjs`**_. You can be a newbie react developer, no problem, as long as you feel comfortable with reactjs, as long as you know what is _**state, props, useEffect, useState,**_ then you can keep going.

- If you know what these things are and you know how to _**make a website and an application using Reactjs**_ then you can keep going.

&nbsp;

## 1.3 Software Requirements

- let's talk about _**the software that you need**_ to take this course and I'm gonna be honest with you. _**the worst part of RN**_ is the `setup` _**required to get started with RN**_. It's really annoying.

  - let me explain why, when you are making a RN application, you are _**not making a ~~website~~**_, you are _**not making a ~~mobile website~~**_, you are _**actually making**_ an `app`, an `iOS` and `Android application`.

&nbsp;

- This means that you have to _**download**_ and to _**have all the software required**_ to make apps. The point is we're making an `app` so we need to _**download the things that normal app developers have**_

  - if you're making `Android` applications we need to _**download `Android studio`**_ which is the software that Android developers use.
  - we have to _**download `java`**_, and we have to _**install java in our computer**_. We also have to _**download the `Android sdk`**_, the _**android software development kit**_.
  - we have to download _**the `simulator`**_, and the developer tools like all the things required to make an Android application

&nbsp;

- also if you are in `iOS`, or `macOS`, you have to _**download Xcode**_ and we have to _**install the simulators**_. now It's way easier, so much easier to just install xcode and the simulators in macOS. It's super simple.

- It's little bit harder to _**configure Android studio**_ and _**download java and sdks**_ is not that easy.

&nbsp;

### The point is _**there are many things we have to download**_, and _**install**_.

- I don't want to start my course like that.

  1. I would like to _**start as quickly as possible `coding`**_. I want to experience RN as quickly as possible.
  2. many people have _**many problems on the `installation part`**_. The installation doesn't always work so well.
  3. awesome community has built some tools that we can use. so we can _**get started immediately `testing RN`**_ and _**making `RN applications`**_ and _**testing them in our phone**_ without downloading any ~~software, java, android studio, anything~~.

&nbsp;

- we are able to _**go from our VScode**_ and _**test the application right in our phone**_. that's exactly what we're going to be doing.

- We're going to be using that beautiful tool that allows us to _**skip all this simulator installation**_ and _**get started immediately making code**_ and _**looking at the result right in our phone**_.

&nbsp;

- The tool we're going to be using is used for a lot of testing purposes. It's _**built for testing**_ It's _**built for prototyping**_. It's built for when you _**don't want to install anything**_, you want to get started quickly making an idea and testing how it will feel on the phone.

- If you want to _**send the applications to the app store**_, If you want to _**customize your applications**_, you will have to _**download and install java and the simulators**_ and everything. but that is not a requirement to start the course.

- when the course finishes, you will choose if you want to _**do the**_ `full RN installation`. then I will show you how you have to install everything so you can _**actually**_ `make applications` by yourself _**without using the testing tool**_.

&nbsp;

- What do you actually _**need to take this course**_, all you need to do is _**go to your terminal**_ and I need you to _**be able to run node**_. so as long as you have _**nodejs installed**_ and of course _**npm installed**_, then we are good to go.

```bash
$ node -v
// If you have a version higher than 14.17 then you are good to go
```

&nbsp;

- see you on the next video, where we are going to understand _**how does RN work**_ and why is it _**so different**_ that we are able to _**skip the simulator installation**_ and instead use the tool that we're going to be using on this course.
